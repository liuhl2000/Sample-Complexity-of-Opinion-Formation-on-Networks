There are three main files "utils.py", "Degree and Samples.py", and "Tight Bounds Plot.py", which will be explained more below. The folders are used to store figures. The "130bit.txt", "econ-mahindas.txt", "email-Eu-core-temporal.txt", and "facebook_combined.txt" are data of real-world networks.



Running the code requires the Python packages "networkx" and "cvxpy"



### utils.py

This file contains all auxiliary functions



### Degree and Samples.py

This file contains code for plotting the sample-degree dependence for both synthetic and real-world networks.



### Tight Bounds Plot.py

This file contains code for visualizing the tightness of bounds and their relative error.
